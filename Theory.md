In Previous Time When We used to use SOAP services. We used to use XML APIs which used to return XML.
Those APIs Were based upon SOAP Technologies. But as we are moving towards modern javascript, React, Angular, ViewJS, So We do not write HTML, CSS and JavaScript From Scratch.

That is the reason why today we need such a technology which is human redable and it gets integrated with javascript easily.

In XML we had opening and closing tags so there were lot of problems which we faced because we were using opening and closing tags and then when we used to parse big-big XMLs that is less human redable.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): Here we can integrate Front end + Json Very easily.
It is very light weighted.

If We are getting Front end + XML => Lot of headache.

To Use the code within the console of our chrome -> 
Step1:
Json = `{
    "name": "Harry",
    "score": 11.75,
    "isAdmin": false,
    "license": null
}`
Step2:
JSON.parse(Json)
Step3:
You can access any of the index or object that you wants to do so.
